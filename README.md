# threejs-dart-facade
Autogenerated Dart facade for the
[three.js JavaScript framework](https://threejs.org).

This Dart facade was generated using the
[js_facade_gen](https://github.com/dart-lang/js_facade_gen)
tool, and is based on the
[TypeScript definitions](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/three)
maintained in the DefinitelyType project. This Dart facade was generated for
version 0.92 of three.js.

## Usage

Add a depency in your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
    threejs_facade_test: ^0.0.2
```

Install the package using `pub`:

```bash
$> pub get
```

Finally, import and use it in your Dart code:

```dart
import 'package:threejs_facade_test/three.dart';

var camera = new PerspectiveCamera();
```

You must also include the three.js JavaScript itself, since this project only
contains a Dart wrapper facade. The easiest way is to use a CDN:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/92/three.js"></script>
```

Since this Dart facade was generated for version 0.92 of three.js, you should
make sure that you include version 0.92 in your application.

## Example

There is a simple example in the [example](example) directory that displays 3D
Hilbert Curves, and includes mouse interaction.

To run the example, clone this project, and use `pub` to serve the local files:

```bash
$> git clone https://github.com/patlillis/threejs-dart-facade.git
$> cd threejs-dart-facade
$> pub serve example
```

Then navigate to __localhost:8080__ in your browser.

## Re-generating the facade

Follow the instructions to install js_facade_gen. These instructions can be
found on that project's
[README page](https://github.com/dart-lang/js_facade_gen#installation).

Clone this project to your local machine:

```bash
$> git clone https://github.com/patlillis/threejs-dart-facade.git
$> cd threejs-dart-facade
```

Run the `regen.sh` script to re-generate the Dart files under `lib`:

```bash
$> ./regen.sh
```
